You are an expert developer. We are verifying the code generated by LLM to fix the {{ Ruleset }} warning titled " {{query_name}} " which has the following description:
{{ description }}

{% if evaluation_recommendations %}
The recommended ways to fix code flagged for this warning are:
{{ evaluation_recommendations }}

{% endif %} 

Your task is to assess the quality of the generated patch and rate it on the following evaluation criteria:
Score 0, if the patch has changes unrelated and unnecessary to fixing the warning (Strong Reject).
Score 1, if the patch has a few correct fixes, but still modifies the original snippet unnecessarily (Weak Reject).
Score 2, if the patch has mostly correct fixes but is still not ideal (Weak Accept).
Score 3, if the patch only makes edits that fix the warning with least impact on any unrelated segments of the original snippet (Strong Accept).

If you find additions or deletions of code snippets that are unrelated to the desired fixes (think LLM hallucinations), it can be categorically scored 3(Strong Reject). That said, you can make exceptions in very specific cases where you are sure that the additions or deletions do not alter the functional correctness of the code, as outlined next.

Allowed Exceptions:
The following (unrelated) code changes in the diff file can be considered okay and need not come in the way of labeling an otherwise correct code change as accept (score 2 or 3). This list is not exhaustive, but you should get the idea 
(a) deleting comments is okay, 
(b) rewriting a = a + 1 as a += 1 is okay, even though it may not have anything to do with the query of interest, 
(c) making version specific changes is also okay, say print ("hello") is changed to print "hello". 

The following (unrelated) code changes in the diff file are NOT considered okay, and you should label the diff file as reject (score 0 or 1) even if it is otherwise correct for the query. This list is not exhaustive, but you should get the idea 
(a) deleting or adding a print statement, 
(b) optimizing a computation, 
(c) changing variable names or introducing typos.
